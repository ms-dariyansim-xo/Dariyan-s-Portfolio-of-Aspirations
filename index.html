    <title>Dariyan's Portfolio of Aspirations</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>In my 'Tech Inspirations' blog, I mentioned that one of my hobbies has influenced my fascination with the development in VR/AR
    devices. This is part of my consideration of specializing in  AI or Machine Learning, with aspirations to create and design
two potential projects. (Of course with many more to come).</p>
<p>For one, I was born deaf, but with the help of hearing aids, I'm technically hard-of-hearing. This "hybrid" lifestyle I had being part of a deaf
    community, came with exposure to a handful of technologies designed to assist deaf and HoH individuals. This prompts
    a passion to create new hearing aids or upgrade audiogram machines (test hearing levels).
<p>I personally have experienced the struggles in accessing services, that ironically created inconveniences than to provide
    the help requested. I would like to change that.</p>
<p>One example would be Relay services, where there would usually be a party of three involved: a deaf caller, the "middleman"
    or Sign Language interpreter, and the party to reach to. 
    One inconvenience could be the availability of the interpreters, lack of resources or poor connectivity. 
    I'm thinking of developing a communicative device with a hologram-like projection, with a "robotic or computerized" Sign Language interpreter.
